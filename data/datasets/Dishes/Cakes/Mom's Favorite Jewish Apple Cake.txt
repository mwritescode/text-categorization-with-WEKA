Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10-inch tube pan.
Mix 5 tablespoons sugar and cinnamon together in a large bowl. Add apple slices and toss to coat.
Mix flour, 2 cups sugar, oil, orange juice, eggs, baking powder, salt, and vanilla extract together in another bowl and beat until smooth and thoroughly blended. Batter will be thick.
Place 1/2 of the batter in the prepared tube pan. Top with 1/2 of the apple slices. Add remaining batter to the pan, and neatly arrange remaining apple slices on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Let cool in the pan for 1 hour. Run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert carefully onto a cooling rack to cool completely.
