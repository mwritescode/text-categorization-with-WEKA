Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add cherry tomatoes and quickly stir until tomatoes just begin to soften, 1 to 2 minutes. Add zucchini noodles, salt, and pepper. Keep cooking, stirring frequently, until zoodles are tender yet firm to the bite, 2 to 3 minutes.
Remove from heat and stir in mozzarella and basil. Toss to coat. Divide zoodles between 4 bowls and drizzle with balsamic glaze. Serve immediately.
