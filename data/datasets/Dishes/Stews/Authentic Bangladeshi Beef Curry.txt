Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue cooking and stirring until the onion is very tender and dark brown, 15 to 20 minutes more.
Stir in the garlic, green chiles, ginger paste, cardamom seeds, cloves, and cinnamon sticks. Cook and stir until the garlic begins to brown, 3 to 5 more minutes.
Mix cumin, coriander, turmeric, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and water into the onion mixture. Simmer until most of the water has evaporated and the mixture has thickened.
Stir in beef chuck pieces until coated with spice mixture; simmer over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the beef is cooked through and tender, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
