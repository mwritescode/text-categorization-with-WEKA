Heat vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. Sprinkle beef with salt and black pepper and brown in the hot oil with garlic, about 10 minutes. Pour in water, pineapple juice, onion, tomato sauce, and tomato paste. Bring to a boil, turn heat to low, and simmer until beef is almost tender, 35 to 45 minutes.
Stir potatoes, red bell pepper, carrot, mini sausages, pineapple chunks with their juice, olives, and bay leaves into the stew. Bring back to a boil and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 20 more minutes. Season with hot pepper sauce, salt, and black pepper.
