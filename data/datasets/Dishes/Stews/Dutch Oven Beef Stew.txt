Stir flour, paprika, salt, and pepper together in a medium bowl. Add beef and toss until coated with flour mixture.
Heat oil in a cast iron Dutch oven or large pot over medium-high heat. Add beef and sear until well browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Stir in broth, potatoes, mushrooms, carrots, onion, celery, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, and bay leaves and cover.
Reduce heat to low, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until meat and vegetables are tender, about 2 1/2 hours.
