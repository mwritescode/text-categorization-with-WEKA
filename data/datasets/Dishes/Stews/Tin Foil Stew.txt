On a large square sheet of foil, layer beef, potato cubes, carrots, onion and garlic. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, top with butter and a tablespoon of water.
Roll edges of tin foil together and seal tightly.
Bury it in campfire coals or put in a preheated oven at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). For either cooking method, cooking time is about 1 hour. You can eat it right out of the foil, or empty it into a dish.
